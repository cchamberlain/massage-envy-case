# Massage Envy Complaints

Massage Envy Franchising, LLC and it's [Irvine Northpark Plaza](http://www.massageenvy.com/clinics/CA/Irvine-Northpark-Plaza-.aspx) and [Manhattan Beach](http://www.massageenvy.com/clinics/CA/Manhattan-Beach.aspx) franchisees use aggressive, deceptive and unethical sales and retention practices. After binding myself to a year contract with Massage Envy on 8/21/2014, I found that I was directly lied to by the sales agent during contract discussions.  Specifically I was told that (a) I would have the ability to transfer unlimited unused massages from my account to a guest with a surcharge but no other limitations, (b) any massages accrued over the course of my contract could be used post-cancellation of my contract and would not expire, and (c) after my year contract was up, that I would be transitioned to a month-to-month billing cycle which could be cancelled easily at any time. I eventually found out that each of these three verbal promises were untrue.

To date I have only used four of my 14 accrued massages due to high anxiety caused by dealings with Massage Envy sales and retention staff. I am two months past my contract end date and am unable to even cancel my account without paying for an additional month due to me signing into Massage Envy's unethical contract on the basis of fraudulent claims by the sales and front desk staff at the Irvine Northpark Plaza franchisee location. I am filing a Better Business Bureau complaint and will be seeking legal counsel if my account is not immediately terminated on the date this is received.

### My Experience

I went into Massage Envy, Irvine Northpark Plaza franchise on 8/21/2014 looking to try out their massages with the intention of signing up for their services on that date. I am not the type to fall for sales pitches and will usually put up a wall when I hear them coming on. There sales pitch was extremely aggressive, I nearly walked out but ended up signing up because I had pre-planned to and wanted to start getting regular massages with my girlfriend.

I was told by the sales agent that as a member I could:

* at any time transfer my unused passes to a guest, who could use them as often as they like, with a small surcharge.
* any massages I accrue over the year *will not expire* and I can use them post-cancellation until all are fulfilled.
* cancel after completion of my year contract.

###### First Offense

First and second massages went fine (aside from upsell pressure from the sales staff) but I brought my girlfriend along to my third massage on a guest pass using one of my unused accrued massages. I had moved from Irvine to LA so this was at the Manhattan Beach location. Nothing about this guest pass was guest-like, instead she got a very aggressive sales pitch.

The saleswoman told my girlfriend that she needs a lot of massage work (due to non-existant issues) and that she also needs to sign up for a year contract. I told the saleswoman that I only go once every couple months and that she will be using the other half of my massages and therefore does not need to sign up. The saleswoman informs me that a guest can only use one of my passes every 6 months.  This was the last time I cared to deal with Massage Envy and have not returned.

###### Second Offense

I had my credit card information change in June 2015 and I had to call the Irvine Northpark Plaza location to setup a different credit card to fulfill the remainder of my payments. I confirmed I could cancel my account over the phone at anytime after my contract had ended (8/21/2015). He urged me to wait until 9/20/2015 (one day before my contract would renew) so that my accrued massages would be good for the longest period of time. Since I was still under the assumption that my accrued massages would not be expire, this came as a surprise. He told me that the accrued massages are only good for 1 month post-cancellation of my account.

###### Last Straw

I missed the first cancellation because I was out of town. On 10/17/2015 I called Massage Envy Northpark Plaza location to cancel. The woman taking the call first told me that I would be able to cancel after my next bill (10/21/2015) to which I informed her that my account went month-to-month on 8/21/2015 and that I am eligible to cancel now. She responded by telling me that I need to sign some form and send it back to them. On receiving this form, its quite clear how awful Massage Envy's business practices really are.

The form is covered in legal statements that are clearly trying to prolong the cancellation process, even post-expiration of the contract. Specifically it says that the cancellation requires a 30-day written notice and that the cancellation requiest must be reviewed and approved by a clinic manager, and that the clinic must first discuss cancellation options and procedures with me. This is another clear purposeful verbal contradiction from their sales team.
